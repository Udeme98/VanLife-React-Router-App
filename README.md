# VanLife Website

The purpose of building the VanLife Website is to enhance my understanding of [React Router](https://www.reactrouter.com), and how it aids the seamless navigation of websites and web apps.

## Concepts

I learnt about the following concepts in React Router:

1. React Router - React Router is a React library, that is used for client-side rendering.
2. React-router-dom - An npm package, that enables one implement dynamic routing web apps. For this project, I implemented React-router-dom v6.
3. BrowserRouter - BrowserRouter is usually used as a wrapper around the rest of the application to enable routing functionality.
4. Route/Routes - Routes are used to determine what content or component should be displayed on the screen, based on the URL the user has accessed. It contains a few prop( path, element, etc).
5. Path - Specifies the URL path that the route should match.
6. Element - The element props specifies the React component that should be rendered when the route matches the URL defined by the path.
7. Fetchin and mapping out data from [Miragejs](https://www.miragejs.com)(which served as a Mock up API, and hold our data in place of a backend service)
8. useParams() hook
9. Nested Routes
10. Layout Route
